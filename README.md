🔐 Environment Variables Setup

To securely connect your backend to the Google Sheets API, ensure you’ve configured the following:
	1.	Service Account Key File
Save the credentials JSON file from Google Cloud as credentials.json in your backend directory:

/backend/credentials.json


	2.	Environment Variables (.env)
Create a .env file in your backend directory with the following:

SPREADSHEET_ID=1yEq5WE5E7kQd_vLgE7HM99v4NiFewLTs6L5uXcI-G38

Optionally, you can store the path to your credentials file if you’re using dynamic loading:

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./credentials.json



Make sure .env and credentials.json are listed in your .gitignore to avoid leaking sensitive data.
